<s>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is known for its tilt, but you may be unaware of the reason why it stands so askew. The tower was designed to lean to the west, while the ground beneath it tilted to the north, causing the tower to tilt slowly over time. However, thanks to a new study, scientists have discovered why this happened and the role of groundwater in the tower's tilt.
The tower is a symbol of the Italian city of Pisa and was built on marshy ground, which had to be drained to build the tower. This draining caused the ground beneath the tower to tilt,

<s>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is known for its infamous tilt, and it's fascinating how this happens.
The tower's tilt is caused by water accumulating in the foundation, as it moves towards the center of gravity.
But it wasn't always this way.
In fact, the tower was built without proper foundations or a proper inclination.
During construction, the tower sank into the ground, creating an uneven surface that allowed water to seep into the cracks.
It continued to sink, with each passing year, until it tilted.
This makes it an interesting example of how a
